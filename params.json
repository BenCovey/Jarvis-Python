That really opened up a couple of possibilities, such as coding at home. Once I grasped VB I was able to expand and develop my skills and techniques into other languages, including Python, Java, C++, HTML, PHP, SQL, and a few others. If asked my favorite coding language I would most likely answer Python. Reason being that my personal assistant 'Jarvis' (yes I totally stole that name because I love Iron man) was completely coded in Python to start with, I started the program before I could even write a loop. From there I learned skills well beyond the curriculum, and implement them into other languages as well. \r\n\r\n\r\n This portfolio is to showcase some of my work, all of the work published can be downloaded as individually files, or \r\nzipped up. All of the work on the e-portfolio is completely my own, and none has been taken by other sources. \r\n",
