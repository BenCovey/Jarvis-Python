<hr>

<p>I found myself interested in programming in high school when I took a programming course in Visual Basic. That really opened up a couple of possibilities, such as coding at home. Once I grasped VB I was able to expand and develop my skills and techniques into other languages, including Python, Java, C++, HTML, PHP, SQL, and a few others. If asked my favorite coding language I would most likely answer Python. Reason being that my personal assistant 'Jarvis' (yes I totally stole that name because I love Iron man) was completely coded in Python to start with, I started the program before I could even write a loop. From there I learned skills well beyond the curriculum, and implement them into other languages as well. </p>

<p>This portfolio is to showcase some of my work, all of the work published can be downloaded as individually files, or 
zipped up. All of the work on the e-portfolio is completely my own, and none has been taken by other sources. </p>
